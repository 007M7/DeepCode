# `@deepseek-ai/dsh`

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

The `dsh` command is the product launcher for profiles: ordered stacks of plugin-bundle patch layers under the user's own overrides. [`src/args.ts`](src/args.ts) owns the command grammar, and [`src/bin.ts`](src/bin.ts) loads only the selected runner. Invalid commands, options from another mode, configuration errors, and boot failures exit nonzero.

## Entry modes

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `dsh --profile <name>` | Boot the named profile under `$DSH_HOME/profiles/<name>`. |
| `dsh --profile headless "task"` | Run one fresh persisted session, print the final answer, and exit. |
| `dsh web` | Alias of `--profile web`. |
| `dsh plugin --profile <name> <pnpm args>` | Manage a profile's plugins by forwarding to pnpm in the profile directory. |

The invoking directory is the default workspace root. The `web` and `headless` profiles auto-initialize on first use from shipped templates; any other profile must be created through `dsh plugin`.

## App arguments

The launcher parses only its own flags and hands everything after them to the booted profile, where that app's own startup row parses them ([`dsh-cmdline`](../../packages/boot/cmdline/README.md)). Launcher flags therefore come first, and the first token the launcher does not recognize starts the app's arguments:

```sh
dsh --profile web --port 8080       # --port belongs to the web app
dsh --profile tui --resume <id>     # --resume belongs to the terminal app
dsh --profile headless "run the tests"
dsh --profile web --help            # the web app's flags, not the launcher's
dsh --help                          # the launcher's own help
```

## Profiles

A profile directory holds a `package.json` (out-of-tree plugin dependencies plus the profile manifest `dsh.profile` with its ordered `bundles` list) and a `cordis.patch.yml` (the user's own patch layer, hot-reloaded on long-lived surfaces). The tree composes over an empty root: each bundle's patch in `dsh.profile.bundles` order, then the profile's `cordis.patch.yml`, then the home-level `$DSH_HOME/cordis.patch.yml`, then `--patch` overlays. Bundles named in `dsh.profile.bundles` resolve from the dsh installation first (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-base`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-app`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-headless`), then from the profile's own `node_modules`, where pnpm installs out-of-tree plugins. Use `--dump-default-config` and `--dump-config` to inspect the composed tree without booting it.

The [CLI behavior reference](reference/README.md) owns exact layer precedence, flags, shutdown behavior, deployment defaults, and the source launcher.

## Development

Production runs require built package and frontend artifacts. From a checkout, `pnpm run dsh` runs the TypeScript entry and forwards arguments; the [source-launcher reference](reference/README.md#source-launcher) describes the PATH symlink and module-resolution contract.
